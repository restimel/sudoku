## Goal

The purpose was mainly to do some test with VueJS framework and watch its reactivity.

It only tells if the grid is valid (no digits are displayed twice in the same row/column/square) and displays possible values.
It solves very simple cases (when only one value is possible in a case), it is currently out of scope to improve the solving method.
